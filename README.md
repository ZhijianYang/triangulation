## Maximum likelihood estimation of operating characteristics

Without a gold standard, operating characteristics of different testing methods can be estimated by maximum likelihood. As long as:

- **At least 3** distinct methods are applied on the same set of tests;
- The methods are **conditionally independent**, i.e., given a single test result of one method, we know nothing about the result of another method.
